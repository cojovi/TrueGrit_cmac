Got it. Here’s the no‑fluff deep dive on **Bolt** (ECI Software Solutions) — the one at **app.bolttech.net**, not the checkout or ride‑hailing companies with the same name.

## **TL;DR**

**Bolt** is a web \+ mobile project/scheduling system built for **residential homebuilding trade contractors** (FOR THIS APPLICATION WE ARE CONCENTRATING ON ROOFING, framing, AND RESIDENTIAL WINDOWS etc.). It centralizes **builder POs/work orders → scheduling/crew comms → field execution (time, photos) → job costing/profit → accounting** with builder‑portal integrations. The newer **Bolt Enterprise** layer adds **purchasing \+ inventory** tightly tied to schedules/costing.

## **Core modules & how they work**

### **1\) Scheduling & builder order intake**

* **Pull builder POs/orders** into Bolt so you don’t live in multiple portals; **accept POs in one click** from inside Bolt. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/scheduling/)

* **Drag‑and‑drop** and real‑time crew assignment; when dates change, updates cascade. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/)

* **“Job ready” confirmations** help prevent wasted trips. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

### **2\) Project management (job folders)**

* One place for **plans, work orders, photos, contracts, material pull sheets**, etc., with fast search. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/project-management/)

* **P\&L at the job** using invoiced totals \+ actual labor/material costs. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/project-management/)

### **3\) Estimating (templates & volume bids)**

* **Pre‑built templates**, cloning, and labor‑pay estimates to crank out high‑volume bids and update costs as pricing moves. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/estimating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Estimating feeds **pull sheets** and later **profit reports** (single source of truth for quantities/costs). [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

### **4\) Field execution & communication (mobile)**

* Crews see **only their work**; update **status, time, location logs, notes, photos**; **online/offline** capable; **English/Spanish** UI follows device language. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* Centralized in‑app notes/alerts reduce texts/emails; automated crew assignment emails if you still want them. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/communication/)

### **5\) Job profit & costing**

* **Automated profit/loss per scheduled job** with drill‑downs into invoices, pull sheets, and pay items; **threshold alerts** for low margins. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/job-profit/)

### **6\) Reporting & dashboards**

* **Bolt Insights** dashboards \+ reports for **scheduling status, productivity (wasted trips, rework), crew timesheets/payroll**, and **revenue** (invoicing/forecasting/workload). [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/reporting/)

---

## **Builder & back‑office integrations (what’s built‑in)**

* **D.R. Horton (VendorSuite):** Bolt **bypasses** the portal — scheduled data \+ POs flow straight into Bolt. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **ECI MarkSystems (ITK):** Pull **dates, POs, docs** without logging into ITK. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **ADP:** **User provisioning** from ADP into Bolt (hire/terminate sync). [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **Other listings:** Vendor directories say Bolt integrates with **NetSuite** and offers an **API**; official public API docs for Bolt aren’t posted on ECI’s site. Treat this as “available by request.” [GetApp](https://www.getapp.com/construction-software/a/bolt-subcontractor-software/integrations/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## **Bolt Enterprise (what’s new/special)**

* Positioned as **end‑to‑end** project **and inventory** management for larger trades: **real‑time cost tracking, inventory, purchasing**, and tighter estimating with live pricing. [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eci-software-solutions-to-unveil-first-end-to-end-project-and-inventory-management-software-for-homebuilding-tradesat-2025-international-builders-show-302379060.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Goal: increase profit by linking **estimating ↔ purchasing ↔ inventory ↔ schedule** so materials arrive just‑in‑time and costs stay accurate at the lot/job level. [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eci-software-solutions-to-unveil-first-end-to-end-project-and-inventory-management-software-for-homebuilding-tradesat-2025-international-builders-show-302379060.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## **Inventory & purchasing (Enterprise)**

* **Real‑time inventory** (warehouse/on‑site), **lot‑specific costing**, and **schedule‑aware purchasing** so crews have the right materials at the right time. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/inventory-management/)

* **Data‑driven price forecasting** to reduce rush orders/overstock and improve vendor negotiations; inventory/purchasing, scheduling, and costing live in **one system**. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/inventory-management/)

---

## **Typical flow (end‑to‑end)**

1. **Builder PO/work order** appears in Bolt (from VendorSuite/ITK/etc.). [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

2. Scheduler **accepts/slots** it; crews get assignments and **job‑ready** confirmations. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/scheduling/)[Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

3. Field uses mobile app for **status, time, photos, location logs** (even offline). [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

4. Materials flow via **pull sheets**; **inventory/purchasing** aligns to schedule (Enterprise). [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)[ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/inventory-management/)

5. **Job profit** auto‑calculates; accounting pushes **jobs/invoices** to QuickBooks/Sage/Spectrum. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/job-profit/)[Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

## **What makes Bolt stand out**

* **Builder‑portal deep links** (e.g., DR Horton, MarkSystems ITK) eliminate portal hopping — a real‑world painkiller for production builders’ trades. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **One‑click PO acceptance** and **crew job‑ready checks** reduce dry runs. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/scheduling/)[Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **Lot‑level profitability** baked into everyday ops (not just an after‑the‑fact report). [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/job-profit/)

* **Mobile built for crews** (restricted job views, offline, bilingual) to boost adoption. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **Enterprise: inventory \+ purchasing** tied directly to schedules and costing — rarer in trade‑contractor tools. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/inventory-management/)[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eci-software-solutions-to-unveil-first-end-to-end-project-and-inventory-management-software-for-homebuilding-tradesat-2025-international-builders-show-302379060.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Vendor claims **88% faster scheduling/crew comms**, **2× job capacity**, and **\~2800% gross profit margin growth** on their site (marketing numbers, but that’s their pitch). [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/)

## **Mobile apps & data practices**

* **Android app** shows \~**2.7★** (≈80 reviews); recent notes include crew‑pay controls and contract creation in‑app. **Data encrypted** in transit; user can request deletion. [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=net.bolttech.bolt)

* Google Play **Data Safety** lists potential collection of **location, personal info, device IDs, photos/videos, files/docs, crash logs**; developer reports **no third‑party sharing**. (As always, your mileage may vary.) [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/datasafety?id=net.bolttech.bolt&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **iOS app** description highlights **builder system \+ QuickBooks integration**, **auto confirmations**, **labor/material tracking**. [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eci-bolt/id583753013?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## **Known limitations & caveats**

* **Pricing** isn’t publicly posted; it’s demo/sales‑led. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/)

* **API docs** for Bolt aren’t public on ECI’s site; 3rd‑party listings claim an API — expect to go through sales/support to access. [GetApp](https://www.getapp.com/construction-software/a/bolt-subcontractor-software/integrations/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Mobile UX stability**: Android reviews are mixed; if your crews are Android‑heavy, pilot first. [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=net.bolttech.bolt)

---

## **Short feature checklist (for quick eyes)**

* **Builder PO ingestion** (DR Horton VendorSuite, MarkSystems ITK) → accept in Bolt. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **Scheduling**: drag‑drop, real‑time crew updates, job‑ready confirmations. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/)[Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **Estimating**: templates, cloning, labor‑pay estimates; feeds pull sheets/cost. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/estimating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **Field app**: limited job visibility, time/location logs, photos, offline, EN/ES. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)

* **Job profit**: auto P\&L per job/lot with drill‑downs \+ alerts. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/job-profit/)

* **Reporting**: Bolt Insights dashboards; payroll/timesheets; productivity/rework; revenue/invoice/forecast. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/reporting/)

* **Accounting**: QuickBooks (incl. Enterprise), Sage 300, Spectrum. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)[customerportal.ecisolutions.com](https://customerportal.ecisolutions.com/s/article/Bolt-Integration-with-QuickBooks-Enterprise?language=en_US&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Specific things to remember**: along with all the Bolt Menu's , this app also factors in the "Floorplans" so there is a floorplans menu to upload floorplans, assign a floorplan to each job or house, etc.
ALSO a menu item for "Communities" where the neighborhoods are catalogued .

* **Enterprise add‑ons**: inventory, purchasing, cost tracking integrated with schedules. [ECI Software Solutions](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/features/inventory-management/)[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eci-software-solutions-to-unveil-first-end-to-end-project-and-inventory-management-software-for-homebuilding-tradesat-2025-international-builders-show-302379060.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## **Bottom line**

If you’re a production‑builder trade, Bolt’s superpower is killing portal roulette and wiring **builder orders → schedules → crews → costs** in one place — and, with Enterprise, bringing **materials/purchasing** into that same loop. Do a field pilot (especially on Android) and confirm API/integration specifics with ECI before you bet the farm. [Builders Show](https://www.buildersshow.com/assets/docs/ibs/logos/ExhibitorProductLit_101849_ECIBoltOverview.pdf)[ECI Software Solutions+1](https://www.ecisolutions.com/products/bolt-trade-contractor-software/)[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=net.bolttech.bolt)
