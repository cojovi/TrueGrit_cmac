  # Fix Authentication and RLS Policies

  This migration fixes the infinite recursion in RLS policies and ensures proper authentication flow.

  1. Simplified Policies
    - Remove recursive profile lookups
    - Use direct auth.uid() checks
    - Enable basic CRUD operations

  2. Authentication Support
    - Ensure profiles can be created and read
    - Fix user session handling
    - Add proper default roles
